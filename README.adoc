= Spiracle

Spiracle is an insecure web application used to test system security controls. 

It can be used to read/write arbitrary files and open network connections. The application is also vulnerable to SQL Injection.

CAUTION: Due to its insecure design, this application should NOT be deployed on an unsecured network.

This application has been tested on the following application servers:

* Apache Tomcat 7.x
* IBM WebSphere Liberty Core 8.5.5.3

Your mileage may vary with other application servers.

== Installation

* Download pre-built `spiracle.war` file from the releases page: https://github.com/waratek/spiracle/releases

=== Tomcat

* Copy the war file to the `$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/` directory

=== Liberty Core

* Ensure that the application war file is extracted to your server's apps directory:

----
$ mkdir ./wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/apps/spiracle
$ cd ./wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/apps/spiracle
$ jar xvf /path/to/downloaded/spiracle.war
----

* Modify `server.xml` as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<server description="new server">
  <!-- Enable features -->
  <featureManager>
    <feature>jsp-2.2</feature>
    <feature>Servlet-3.0</feature> <!--1-->
  </featureManager>

  <webApplication contextRoot="spiracle" location="spiracle"/> <!--2-->
  <httpSession idLength="28" /> <!--3-->

  <httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint" 
                host="*" <!--4-->
                httpPort="9080" 
                httpsPort="9443"/>
</server>
----

<1> Enable `Servlet-3.0` as a feature
<2> Add a `webApplication` tag referencing Spiracle
<3> Change `httpSession` parameter length 
<4> Add a `host` attribute

=== Database setup

If you would like to run the SQL injection tests, the database should be populated as follows. Data files are available in the web applications `spiracle/conf/` directory after the `spiracle.war` file has been deployed and exploded.

==== Oracle

. Ensure that the link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/jdbc-112010-090769.html[Oracle Database JDBC Driver] (ojdbc6.jar) is installed in the applications `WEB-INF/lib/` directory after the `spiracle.war` file is exploded on first run.
. Import the data:
+
----
$ sqlplus SYS/password@//127.0.0.1:1521/XE AS SYSDBA < setupdb_oracle.sql
----
+
NOTE: This will create a user `test` with password `test`. You should adjust usernames and/or connection URLs dependent on your environment
+
. Configuration parameters for the Oracle JDBC connection are defined in `conf/Spiracle.properties`:
+
----
c3p0.classname=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
c3p0.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE
c3p0.username=test
c3p0.password=test
----

NOTE: It may be necessary to restart your application server after deploying the `ojdbc6.jar` or updating database configuration.

==== MySQL
. Import the data:
+
----
$ mysql -u root -p test < setupdb_mysql.sql
----
+
NOTE: This will create a user `test` with password `test`. You should adjust usernames and/or connection URLs dependent on your environment
+
. Configuration parameters for the MySQL JDBC connection are defined in `conf/Spiracle.properties`:
+
----
c3p0.classname=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
c3p0.url=jdbc:jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test
c3p0.username=test
c3p0.password=test
----

NOTE: Spiracle is bundled with MySQL Connector 5.1.35. If this version is not compatible with your MySQL installation replace `mysql-connector-java-5.1.34-bin.jar` under `WEB-INF/lib/` with a compatible version.

== Running

After deployment, the Spiracle application will be available at:

----
http://ip:port/spiracle/
----

== Building

Prerequisites:

* Java >= 1.6
* Apache Ant
* link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/jdbc-112010-090769.html[Oracle Database JDBC Driver] (ojdbc6.jar)

If you wish to use the database features, ensure that the Oracle database JDBC driver file `ojdbc6.jar` is available under `./WebContent/WEB-INF/lib`

To build the Spiracle Test Application WAR file, run:

 ant

or

 ant build

To clean the build infrastructure, run:

 ant clean

The WAR file will be output to:

 ./build/spiracle.war
